# Grid Blogger

In this project, I used my CSS Grid skills to recreate a blog page, closely following the design shown in the reference images below. The goal was to apply CSS Grid to achieve a responsive and well-structured layout.

### Language Used
- **HTML** for the structure of the webpage
- **CSS** for styling, with a focus on CSS Grid for layout

### Features
- Using images from the included **`images`** directory.
- Using the text content from the **`content.txt`** file.
- Matching the layout as closely as possible to the reference design, pixel by pixel.

### Example

![Desktop](./layout_images/desktop.png "desktop version")
